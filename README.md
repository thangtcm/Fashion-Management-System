## Introduction üéâ
Fashion Management System (FMS) is a management system designed to support businesses in the fashion industry in managing their business operations. FMS provides tools for managing production, inventory, sales, finance, and customer management.
<br><br>
FMS also helps fashion designers and manufacturers manage the process of designing and producing fashion products, from planning production to ordering raw materials and tracking the production process. The system also provides a database of fashion trends and information about competitors to help fashion businesses make informed business decisions.
<br><br>
With the increasing growth of the fashion industry and the growing competition, FMS is an important tool to help fashion businesses optimize their business operations and meet market demand.
<p>This system will be mainly used by:</p>
<ul><li>Warehouse management</li><li>Sales management</li><li>Financial management</li><li>Customer management</li><li>Employee management</li></ul>

<p>The Fashion management system we have developed is a desktop application built using Java Swing and the Maven project management tool. Based on the project requirements, we have categorized our system into the following main functions:

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Warehouse management:</strong> Helps manage warehouse activities such as inventory in and out, stock level, inventory audits, location management, and inventory value management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sales management:</strong> Supports sales management activities such as order management, customer management, pricing management, and discount management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial management:</strong> Helps manage financial activities such as expense management, invoice management, production cost management, and revenue management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customer management:</strong> Supports customer information management, purchase history tracking, loyalty program management, and promotional campaign management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee management:</strong> is a feature that manages employee information and grants access to system functions. It helps businesses manage basic employee information and ensure effective data security and management.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>With the efforts of our team members, we have successfully developed a Fashtion Management System that meets the project requirements and exceeds the satisfaction of the stakeholders involved in the project.</p>
