<h1><span style ="color:#4F62CB">Fashion Management System </span></h1>

<p>The Fashion management system we have developed is a desktop application built using Java Swing and the Maven project management tool. Based on the project requirements, we have categorized our system into the following main functions:

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Warehouse management:</strong> Helps manage warehouse activities such as inventory in and out, stock level, inventory audits, location management, and inventory value management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sales management:</strong> Supports sales management activities such as order management, customer management, pricing management, and discount management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial management:</strong> Helps manage financial activities such as expense management, invoice management, production cost management, and revenue management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customer management:</strong> Supports customer information management, purchase history tracking, loyalty program management, and promotional campaign management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee management:</strong> is a feature that manages employee information and grants access to system functions. It helps businesses manage basic employee information and ensure effective data security and management.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>With the efforts of our team members, we have successfully developed a Fashion Management System that meets the project requirements and exceeds the satisfaction of the stakeholders involved in the project.</p>
